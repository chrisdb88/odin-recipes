# odin-recipes

In this project, I will be creating a basic recipe website. By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated basic HTML skills, the ability to embed links, the ability to push the project to github via git functionality in the terminal, and provide clear and concise commit message(s), to clearly indicate changes to hypothetical collaborators.
